# REACT FLICKR APP
This project combines React and Bootstrap to make a simple gallery display.  

It was based on a TeamTreehouse.com project, but the code is my own. The 'trending' functionality was added outside of the project, as was the Bootstrap styling and routes with query strings.

## React-Bootstrap

Using both the React-Bootstrap and Bootstrap libraries, these framworks sped up styling on the project. Using built in grid systems, flexbox, default styles and utility classes, it allowed for a quick, clean setup of the Photo App for multiple sized devices. I wrote some custom HTML because the Bootstrap margin options weren't the best option for a project of this small scale. 

## React Router

Used to create the links and search bar function.
